***Assuming you have built the game and asset builder already***
1. Open the command prompt
2. Change the directory to the path where the Asset_Builder.exe program is
3. Execute the asset builder with all the assets you want to create
	e.g. Asset_Builder.exe -c W:\data\test.fbx W:\data\test_image.png
4. Pending any errors. Confirm a WorldGame.assets file was created in the Asset_Builder directory
5. Rebuild the game and the assets should be usable in the editor.
